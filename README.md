You will have to change anywhere that has $mamp for logging into your database should be in:
* log_in.php
* register.php
-------------------------------------------
Also edit the sql_login.php do fit your needs

FIXES/UPDATE
* login not working
* added header.html
* stays logged in until "logout" is selected

----------------------------------------
NEEDS
* header needs styling
* most likely want a footer
* when getting info on car (valuation.php) add to user history
* be able to view history
* add price changes due to mileage, private-owner etc...

* other things also needed just not sure at the moment
