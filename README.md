You will have to change anywhere that has $mamp for logging into your database should be in:
* log_in.php
* register.php
-------------------------------------------
Also edit the sql_login.php do fit your needs

FIXES/UPDATE
* login not working -> login should be working as intended
* added header.html, footer.html, layout.css, and cars_img.jpg
* stays logged in until "logout" is selected -> should log out properly now.
* Running into a bug where after registration sometimes (I think when there is an input error) you will get a 404 error
* 

----------------------------------------
NEEDS
* when getting info on car (valuation.php) add to user histoty
* be able to view history
* add price changes due to mileage, private-owner etc...

* other things also needed just not sure at the moment
